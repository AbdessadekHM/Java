## Comparison Opeartors 
comparison operators in java are same operators of other languages like javascript, C ...

| Operator | Description                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                            |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                        |
| `>`      | Greater than                        |
| `<`      | Less than                           |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to            |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to               |

## Logical Operator:

| Operator | Description                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND (returns true if both conditions are true) |
| `||`     | Logical OR (returns true if at least one condition is true) |
| `!`      | Logical NOT (reverses the logical state of its operand) |
| `&`      | Bitwise AND (operates at the bit level; can also be used as logical AND without short-circuiting) |
| `|`      | Bitwise OR (operates at the bit level; can also be used as logical OR without short-circuiting) |

> for `&&`if the first expression is false it doesn't evaluate the next one, and for `||` if the first expression is true it doesn't evaluate the next one.
> but for `&` and `|` they always evaluate both sides if they are used as logical operators
