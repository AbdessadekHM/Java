# Exceptions

## What Are Exceptions:
Exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.


`Stack Trace`: when an exception is throwen, it shows the called methods in reverse order.

## Types of Exceptions:
- **Checked Exceptions(Compile time)**: are exceptions that we should handle, like reading data from a file etc...
- **Unchecked Exceptions(Run time)**: are exceptions that we don't need to handle them, because they are came from programming mistakes.
    Examples: 
        - NullPointerException
        - ArithmeticException
        - IllegalArgumentException
        - IndexOutOfBoundException
        - IllegalStateException
- **Errors**: are exceptions related to ressources or jvm itself, we can't not handle it at all, like `StackOverFlow`.
